# Installation

- Clone the repo
- In Chrome; go to extensions
- Tick 'Developer mode' in the top right
- Click 'Load unpacked extension...' in top left
- Select the extension folder
- Done

Then open up a PR and after a few seconds some checkboxes should appear, allowing you to hide the files in the PR. They aren't styled at the moment but they should function at least
